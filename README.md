  directory of the file
- output in Emacs ORG-MODE allowing to see tagged files, directories in a document-like
  format with ability to jump to tagged file, directory
- output in GREP-like format
- color output (optional)
- shell (Bash, ZSH) autocomplete

The tool (easytags) is written in Common Lisp and it is crossplatform, but the author mostly
